Outline for the story:

Intro (10 min) (Omar) 12 slides
 - High level overview of information access (search, QA, etc.)
 - What are the components that we need
 - IR stack (indexing, crawling, ranking, query understanding)
 - NLP stack (POS, NER, specific tasks, embeddings, transformers, etc.)
 - HEMU dimensions

Hard (10 min) 7 slides
 - NLP: pre-training (Ken)
 - IR: large-scale indexing, crawling, instrumentation, online experiments (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

Easy (60 min) 63 slides
 - NLP: inference/fit, fine-tuning/predict (Ken)
 - IR: indexing, query, ranking (tf-idf, out-the-box BM25, etc.) (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

--- Break ---

Medium/Not-so-hard (40 min)  46 slides
 - Historical perspective (Ken)
 - KG (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

Ugly & Applications (50 min) 85 slides
 - Benchmarks (Ken)
 - Labeling (Omar)
 - Bias, toxicity, misinformation, plagiarism (Ken)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

The application (0 min) 5 slides
 - How can we solve a specific problem using a "better together" approach
 - Hallucination problem
 - Details on how search and KG can help

Conclusions (10 min)



CIKM feedback. Some high level at the moment
- We need to normalize fonts + look & feel (I can do this).
- Trim stuff on certain slides. Some of them are very busy. We can do this at the very end.
- I'd organize the content like this:

1- Introduction
   Terminology and buzz words in DL, IR, NLP, etc.
   How each component is used in IR/NLP (at a high level)
   A bit about building research prototypes and production systems
2- Easy: you are a researcher and practitioner
  What can you do right now with basic efforts
  What other low hanging fruits are out there?
  Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
3- Hard
   Academia vs industry
   Build an LLM; crawl the Web, build a production inverted index etc.
   Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
4- Medium
    I'd organize on the topics are are more related to IR/NLP and then the ones are a bit more tangential (image stuff)
     Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
5- Ugly
      I'd focus on the benchmark/eval first and then bias
      Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
6- Conclusions
