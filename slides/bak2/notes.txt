The important stuff:

- I'd concentrate on fundamentals. There is a lot of noise with the latest models and tons of papers that it is very difficult to assess what's going on. All the latest flops (ie Gemini, etc.) is an indication that a) nobody has a clue in terms of evaluation/benchmarks and b) extremely poor data management practices.
- Our audience is going to be (I think) more technical than CIKM so we need to have a solid tutorial.
- I think we need to update/upgrade some of the sections to reflect the current trends.
- I'd like to include some of the SIGIR paper ideas on eval.
- I'd like to include the task classification concept that we've talked  about in the past.
- Your ChatGPT examples and smooth machines -- we need to expand on that.
- AI Ethics, etc. seems not that relevant lately. I'm mea, a nice feature but it is unclear (technically) what needs to be done. Also, Ricardo is doing a tutorial on this topic so maybe no that interesting to cover (?)

Not so important but good to have:

- Last time we ran out of time. We need to trim content.
- There is duplicate content on the slides -- we need to unify stuff
- Same font/style -- slides are inconsistent

Outline for the story:

Intro (10 min) (Omar) 12 slides
 - High level overview of information access (search, QA, etc.)
 - What are the components that we need
 - IR stack (indexing, crawling, ranking, query understanding)
 - NLP stack (POS, NER, specific tasks, embeddings, transformers, etc.)
 - HEMU dimensions

Hard (10 min) 7 slides
 - NLP: pre-training (Ken)
 - IR: large-scale indexing, crawling, instrumentation, online experiments (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

Easy (60 min) 63 slides
 - NLP: inference/fit, fine-tuning/predict (Ken)
 - IR: indexing, query, ranking (tf-idf, out-the-box BM25, etc.) (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

--- Break ---

Medium/Not-so-hard (40 min)  46 slides
 - Historical perspective (Ken)
 - KG (Omar)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

Ugly & Applications (50 min) 85 slides
 - Benchmarks (Ken)
 - Labeling (Omar)
 - Bias, toxicity, misinformation, plagiarism (Ken)
 - 1 slide on hard problems for researchers/practitioners

The application (0 min) 5 slides
 - How can we solve a specific problem using a "better together" approach
 - Hallucination problem
 - Details on how search and KG can help

Conclusions (10 min)



CIKM feedback. Some high level at the moment
- We need to normalize fonts + look & feel (I can do this).
- Trim stuff on certain slides. Some of them are very busy. We can do this at the very end.
- I'd organize the content like this:

1- Introduction
   Terminology and buzz words in DL, IR, NLP, etc.
   How each component is used in IR/NLP (at a high level)
   A bit about building research prototypes and production systems
2- Easy: you are a researcher and practitioner
  What can you do right now with basic efforts
  What other low hanging fruits are out there?
  Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
3- Hard
   Academia vs industry
   Build an LLM; crawl the Web, build a production inverted index etc.
   Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
4- Medium
    I'd organize on the topics are are more related to IR/NLP and then the ones are a bit more tangential (image stuff)
     Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
5- Ugly
      I'd focus on the benchmark/eval first and then bias
      Research opportunities; pros/cons; pointers to related work
6- Conclusions
